KSEB Energy Futures Platform - Review Notes

Date: 2024-08-16 (Updated 2024-08-17 for Parsers & Integrations)

This document outlines key observations, discrepancies, and areas for future development based on a review of the implemented UI/UX prototype against the provided UI documentation.

**Overall Status:**
- The front-end structure for all specified modules and pages has been implemented.
- HTML templates are in place, extending a base layout.
- CSS provides a unified and refined styling across the platform.
- JavaScript handles basic interactivity, API calls to a mocked backend, and some dynamic content updates (e.g., populating tables, rendering basic charts with Plotly.js).
- The Flask backend is modularized using Blueprints, with API endpoints returning simulated/mocked data. Data persistence is simulated in-memory using `app.config`.

**Key Observations & Discrepancies (aligned with UI Documentation Sections):**

1.  **General:**
    *   **Backend Functionality:** The backend is entirely mocked for core calculations. No actual data processing (beyond Excel parsing), file system operations for project persistence, or database interactions are implemented. This is as per the project's current scope.
    *   **Error Handling:** API error responses are basic. No sophisticated global error handlers or detailed user-facing error pages beyond alerts are implemented. Parsers include basic error/warning prints to console.
    *   **User Authentication/Authorization:** Not implemented.
    *   **Navigation:** Primarily via Home Page Quick Actions and some direct links in base layout.
    *   **State Persistence:** User-uploaded data (parsed Excel content) is stored in `app.config` and persists for the current app session only. Project state, scenario selections, etc., are not persisted across app restarts.

3.  **Project Management (Section 3):** (No changes specific to this review)

4.  **Demand Projection (Section 4):**
    *   **Excel Parsing (`input_demand_file.xlsx`):**
        *   `file_parser.py` implemented with `load_input_demand_data`.
        *   Supports `~Settings Table`, `~Consumption_Sectors Table`, `~Econometric_Parameters Table` (optional) from 'main' sheet.
        *   Reads individual sector sheets and `Economic_Indicators` sheet if econometric parameters are enabled.
        *   Performs merging of economic indicators with sector data (on 'Year' or broadcasting first row).
        *   Aggregates electricity consumption into `aggregated_electricity` DataFrame.
        *   Unit tests (`test_demand_parser.py`) created and pass, covering structure, settings, aggregation, and handling of optional econometric data.
    *   **API Integration:**
        *   `POST /api/demand_projection/upload_demand_file` endpoint now uses the parser, saves uploaded file temporarily, stores parsed data in `app.config['PROCESSED_DEMAND_DATA']`.
        *   `GET /api/demand_projection/chart_data/historical` now sources its data from `app.config['PROCESSED_DEMAND_DATA']['aggregated_electricity']`, reflecting uploaded content.
    *   **UI:** File upload UI on `data_input.html` is functional, and the historical chart updates after successful upload.

5.  **Load Profile Generation (Section 5):**
    *   **Excel Parsing (`load_curve_template.xlsx`):**
        *   `file_parser.py` implemented with `process_load_curve_template`.
        *   Parses 'Past_Hourly_Demand' (handles datetime conversion, resampling to hourly), 'Total Demand' (flexible column names), and optional 'max_demand', 'load_factors' sheets.
        *   Unit tests (`test_load_curve_parser.py`) created and pass, covering full/minimal templates, missing sheets, and malformed data.
    *   **API Integration:**
        *   `POST /api/load_profile/upload_load_curve_template` endpoint uses the parser, saves file temporarily, stores parsed data in `app.config['PROCESSED_LOAD_CURVE_DATA']`.
        *   Other Load Profile APIs (e.g., `/preview`, `/generate`) conceptually acknowledge the presence of this processed data (logged to console) but their core mock logic doesn't fully utilize it yet.
    *   **UI:** File upload UI on `creation.html` is functional, providing feedback.

6.  **PyPSA Modeling (Section 6):**
    *   **Excel Parsing (`pypsa_input_template.xlsx`):**
        *   `file_parser.py` implemented with `parse_pypsa_input_template` and helper `extract_tables_from_sheet_pypsa`.
        *   Special handling for 'Settings' sheet to extract multiple marker-defined tables.
        *   Parses predefined lists of component, time-series, and cost/parameter sheets.
        *   Loads any other custom sheets found in the template.
        *   Unit tests (`test_pypsa_input_parser.py`) created and pass, covering Settings tables, component/timeseries/cost sheets, missing optional sheets, and custom sheets.
    *   **API Integration:**
        *   `POST /api/pypsa_model/upload_pypsa_template` endpoint uses the parser, saves file temporarily, stores parsed data in `current_app.config['PROCESSED_PYPSA_DATA']`.
        *   `POST /api/pypsa_model/validate_model_setup` now retrieves data from `app.config['PROCESSED_PYPSA_DATA']` and performs basic validation checks (e.g., presence of key sheets/tables).
        *   `POST /api/pypsa_model/run_simulation` now checks for presence of processed data.
    *   **UI:** File upload UI on `configuration.html` is functional. "Validate Model" uses the uploaded data context. UI updates (settings display, component summary) after upload are basic.

**Documentation Status:**
-   Python code for new file parsers (`demand_projection/file_parser.py`, `load_profile/file_parser.py`, `pypsa_modeling/file_parser.py`) has module and function-level docstrings and inline comments.
-   Relevant API route functions in `routes.py` for these modules have updated docstrings/comments reflecting the integration of parsers and use of `app.config` for parsed data.
-   JavaScript file upload handlers in `main.js` have comments explaining `FormData` usage, API calls, and UI updates.
-   HTML templates for file upload sections have been reviewed for consistency and commented where necessary.

**Limitations & Future Work (related to parsing & integration):**
-   **Error Propagation:** Parsers print warnings/errors to console but don't return detailed error structures to the API layer. APIs return generic 500s on parsing failures. A more structured error reporting mechanism would be beneficial.
-   **Data Validation within Parsers:** Parsers perform basic structural checks (e.g., presence of columns) but not deep data validation (e.g., data types, value ranges, consistency between tables/sheets). This would be a next step for robustness.
-   **Use of Parsed Data:** While parsed data is stored in `app.config`, its actual *use* in downstream logic (e.g., forecast generation, load profile synthesis, PyPSA model building) is still simulated in most API endpoints. Full integration into these processes is pending.
-   **Security for File Uploads:** While `secure_filename` is used, further security considerations (file type/size limits enforced on server, virus scanning, etc.) would be needed for a production system. Temporary file management is basic.
-   **Scalability of `app.config` Storage:** Storing large parsed Excel data in `app.config` is suitable for this prototype but not for a multi-user or production environment. A proper database or session-specific/project-specific file storage would be needed.

**Conclusion on Excel Parsing Integration:**
The core Excel parsing logic for the three specified template types has been successfully implemented and integrated into their respective module APIs. File upload UIs are functional, and the parsed data is made available within the application context for subsequent (currently mocked) operations. Unit tests provide a good baseline for parser correctness.
